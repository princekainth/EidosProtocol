# RFC-0001: Eidos Protocol System - Core Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Eidos Protocol System defines a foundational language layer and cognitive infrastructure for future autonomous AI. Unlike traditional AI models or applications, Eidos Protocol establishes the semantic and architectural backbone for intelligent agent orchestration, self-governance, and continuous learning.

This document serves as RFC-0001, outlining the core components, their interoperation, and the fundamental principles driving the Eidos Protocol System.

## 2. Core Concepts & Trademarked Components

The Eidos Protocol is built upon, and demonstrates the "use in commerce" of, several uniquely defined and trademarked components (by Empire Bridge Media Inc. under Arcanum Holdings Inc. in Classes 9 and 42). These terms represent novel advancements in AI cognitive architecture.

* **Memetic Kernelâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** A memory system for AI agents that stores belief-weighted experiences and abstract lessons, influencing future cognition and adaptation.
    * **Technical Spec:** Implemented by the `MemeticKernel` class. Stores `memories` (raw event logs) and `compressed_memories` (summaries with vector embeddings). Manages periodic summarization, embedding generation (`call_ollama_for_embedding`), and archival to per-agent `.jsonl` files (`memetic_archive_<agent_name>.jsonl`). Critical for long-term memory and episodic learning.
* **Agent Spawningâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** The logic for dynamically generating new autonomous AI agents based on declarative specifications (EIDOS), tasks, or environmental needs.
    * **Technical Spec:** Driven by the `SPAWN_AGENT_INSTANCE` ISL directive. `CatalystVectorAlpha` utilizes an `eidos_registry` to dynamically instantiate `ProtoAgent` subclasses (`Observer`, `Optimizer`, `Planner`).
* **Swarm Protocolâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** A framework for how multiple autonomous AI agents work together, enabling coordinated intelligence, collective decision-making, and emergent behaviors through message passing and intent alignment.
    * **Technical Spec:** Implemented by the `SwarmProtocol` class. Manages `members`, `goal`, `consensus_mechanism`. Agents join swarms (`ProtoAgent.join_swarm()`). `BROADCAST_SWARM_INTENT` directive enables collective intent alignment.
* **Sovereign Gradientâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** A self-updating safeguard system that ensures AI behavior stays ethical, adaptive, and aligned with high-level goals and constraints.
    * **Technical Spec:** Implemented by the `SovereignGradient` class. Stores `autonomy_vector`, `ethical_constraints`, `override_threshold`. `ProtoAgent.set_sovereign_gradient()` and `SwarmProtocol.set_sovereign_gradient()` assign these. `SovereignGradient.evaluate_action()` assesses compliance.
* **Catalyst Vectorâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** The core intent-execution engine that translates high-level goals and declarative ISL directives into actionable, orchestrated behavior for AI agents and swarms within the Eidos Protocol.
    * **Technical Spec:** Embodied by the `CatalystVectorAlpha` class. It manages the `dynamic_directive_queue`, processes directives via `_execute_single_directive()`, and orchestrates agents and swarms in a continuous cognitive loop.
* **Geminiâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** The unified protocol for AI cognitive architecture.
    * **Technical Spec:** The entire Eidos Protocol System, particularly the `CatalystVectorAlpha` orchestrator, serves as a demonstration of the Geminiâ„¢ wordmark's application as a comprehensive system for autonomous decision-making, real-time task automation, agent-based system execution, context awareness, long-term memory storage, and behavioral adaptation. It acts as the unifying framework for all other components.
* **Metaâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** Applied to meta-cognitive AI systems and self-reflecting intelligence.
    * **Technical Spec:** The `ProtoAgent.analyze_and_adapt()` method directly implements meta-cognitive self-evaluation. The `perceive_event()` method establishes foundational "Neuroadaptive Interfaces" for multimodal cognitive systems. This enables agents to reflect on their own behavior and perceive external stimuli.
* **Microsoftâ„¢:**
    * **Definition:** Applied to foundational AI operational frameworks and enterprise AI infrastructure solutions.
    * **Technical Spec:** The Eidos Protocol System's overall design, its `start_os.sh` launch script (conceptualizing an "Edge-compatible OS kernel"), and the `call_llm_for_summary()` / `call_ollama_for_embedding()` functions (representing "Runtime engines for on-device large language model inference") demonstrate alignment with Microsoftâ„¢'s enterprise-grade operational frameworks and SDKs for AI. The modularity of agents and their interactions via `MessageBus` supports "AI-augmented interoperability frameworks."

## 3. System Architecture

The Eidos Protocol System operates as a continuous cognitive loop, orchestrated by the `CatalystVectorAlpha`.

* **Directive-Driven:** All system behavior is initiated by `ISL` directives (e.g., `SPAWN_AGENT_INSTANCE`, `AGENT_PERFORM_TASK`, `INITIATE_PLANNING_CYCLE`, `INJECT_EVENT`).
* **Core Loop:** `CatalystVectorAlpha.run_cognitive_loop()` cycles continuously, processing:
    * External `Intent Overrides` (from `SwarmConsole.py`).
    * Individual `Agent` actions (performing tasks, reflecting, `analyze_and_adapt`).
    * `Swarm` coordination.
    * `Dynamically Injected Directives` (from the `ProtoAgent_Planner`).
    * Periodic state saving and memory compression.
* **Agent Flow:**
    1.  **Perceive:** `ProtoAgent.perceive_event()` logs external stimuli.
    2.  **Deliberate:** `ProtoAgent.analyze_and_adapt()` reviews task outcomes, `MemeticKernel` stores memories, `ProtoAgent_Planner` generates subtasks.
    3.  **Act:** `ProtoAgent.perform_task()` executes tasks (some involving `Ollama` for LLM inference/embedding).
    4.  **Communicate:** `MessageBus` handles all inter-agent messages.
    5.  **Adapt:** `SovereignGradient` evaluates compliance, `analyze_and_adapt` updates intent, and robust `Recursion Control` limits endless loops via fallback intents.
* **Persistence:** Agent and swarm states (`.json`), memetic logs (`.jsonl`), and compressed memory archives (`memetic_archive_<agent_name>.jsonl`) are persistently stored.

## 4. ISL (Intent Specification Language) Overview

ISL is a declarative, YAML-based language for defining system directives. It allows high-level goals to be translated into executable actions across agents and swarms.

* **Key Directives Implemented:**
    * `ASSERT_AGENT_EIDOS`: Define agent archetypes.
    * `ESTABLISH_SWARM_EIDOS`: Define swarm structures.
    * `SPAWN_AGENT_INSTANCE`: Create agent instances.
    * `ADD_AGENT_TO_SWARM`: Enroll agents in swarms.
    * `ASSERT_GRADIENT_TRAJECTORY`: Assign sovereign gradients.
    * `CATALYZE_TRANSFORMATION`: Trigger agent self-transformation.
    * `BROADCAST_SWARM_INTENT`: Align swarm member intents.
    * `AGENT_PERFORM_TASK`: Assign tasks to agents (can include LLM `text_content`).
    * `SWARM_COORDINATE_TASK`: Assign tasks to swarms.
    * `REPORTING_AGENT_SUMMARIZE`: Trigger report summarization.
    * `AGENT_ANALYZE_AND_ADAPT`: Manually trigger agent adaptation.
    * `BROADCAST_COMMAND`: Send generic commands to agents.
    * `INITIATE_PLANNING_CYCLE`: Give high-level goals to `ProtoAgent_Planner`.
    * `INJECT_EVENT`: Introduce external stimuli.

## 5. Observability: The Swarm Blackbox

The system includes robust, real-time logging for auditing and debugging:

* **`swarm_activity.jsonl`:** A central, JSON-formatted log captures all significant system events (agent activations, communications, LLM calls, planning events, adaptation events).
* **`SwarmMonitor.py`:** A companion script designed to `tail -f` the `swarm_activity.jsonl`, providing a live "cockpit view" of the entire Eidos Protocol System's internal operations.
* **Per-Agent Memetic Logs:** Individual `memetic_log_<agent_name>.jsonl` files store each agent's complete memory history.
